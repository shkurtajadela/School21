# SQL Bootcamp: PostgreSQL, Data Management, and Clean Architecture

This repository contains the work I completed during my SQL bootcamp at School 21. Throughout the bootcamp, I focused on learning how to work with relational databases, specifically PostgreSQL, and gaining a solid understanding of database architecture, query optimization, and data management techniques.

## What I Learned

During the bootcamp, I learned key concepts and practices related to relational databases and SQL, which include:

- **Basic SQL Queries**: Mastered the fundamentals of querying databases, including `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements. Gained experience in filtering, sorting, and joining tables to retrieve the necessary data.
  
- **Common Table Expressions (CTE)**: Learned how to use CTEs to simplify complex queries and improve readability by breaking down long queries into more manageable, reusable components.

- **Database Indexing**: Gained a solid understanding of how indexes improve the performance of database queries, and learned how to create and manage indexes to optimize query speed, especially for large datasets.

- **Key Constraints**: Learned the importance of defining keys in a database, such as **Primary Keys**, **Foreign Keys**, and **Unique Constraints**, to ensure data integrity and consistency.

- **Clean Architecture**: Studied and applied clean architecture principles to design efficient and maintainable database systems. This involved organizing database schemas and queries in a way that adheres to separation of concerns and promotes scalability.

- **Data Lifecycle Management**: Explored techniques for managing the lifecycle of data in a database, including data retention policies, archiving strategies, and efficient ways to handle data deletion and updates over time.

- **Isolation Levels**: Gained an understanding of SQL transaction isolation levels (such as `READ COMMITTED`, `SERIALIZABLE`, and `REPEATABLE READ`) and how they control data consistency and concurrency in multi-user environments.

- **Classical Data Warehouse (DWH)**: Explored concepts related to Data Warehousing, including how to design and manage large-scale databases for analytical purposes. Worked with star and snowflake schemas, and understood ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.

## Key Projects and Tasks

Throughout the bootcamp, I worked on a variety of tasks and projects that helped me apply the concepts I learned. Some of the key tasks include:

1. **Basic SQL Queries**: Writing SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data from relational databases. This involved using `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `JOIN` operations to answer business questions and provide insights into datasets.
  
2. **CTE and Query Optimization**: Implementing CTEs to refactor and optimize complex queries. This allowed for more readable and efficient SQL code, especially when dealing with recursive queries or subqueries.

3. **Indexing and Performance**: Creating indexes to speed up query execution, especially for frequently queried fields or large tables. I learned how to choose the right type of index (e.g., B-tree, hash) based on query requirements.

4. **Database Design**: Applying best practices in database design, such as defining primary and foreign keys, and implementing normalization techniques to ensure data integrity and reduce redundancy.

5. **Data Lifecycle Management**: Developing strategies for managing large amounts of data, such as archiving old data, setting up automatic purging, and implementing data retention policies.

6. **Transaction Management**: Understanding how SQL transactions work and how to use isolation levels to control concurrent access to data, preventing issues such as dirty reads and phantom reads.

7. **Data Warehousing**: Designing and working with Data Warehouse schemas, implementing ETL processes, and querying large datasets to support business intelligence and reporting needs.

## Technologies Used

- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful open-source relational database used throughout the bootcamp for SQL exercises and projects.
- **SQL**: The standard language for managing and querying relational databases.
- **pgAdmin**: A graphical user interface for managing PostgreSQL databases.
- **Data Warehousing (DWH)**: Concepts related to analytical databases, ETL processes, and the organization of large-scale data.

This bootcamp provided me with a deep understanding of relational databases, SQL query optimization, and best practices for managing and querying data at scale. I now have the knowledge and skills necessary to design efficient databases, write complex queries, and work with large datasets in a production environment.
